# 🚀 6-Month AI Systems & Distributed Systems Engineer Roadmap
**Author:** Vinayak Phutane  
**Goal:** Transition from experienced backend developer → AI Systems Engineer with Distributed Systems & Cloud expertise.


---

## 🧭 Overview

This roadmap is designed for a working professional (10AM–7PM IST job, family time, workouts) to skill up *sustainably* — ~1–1.5 hrs on weekdays and 4–5 hrs on weekends.

**Main Goal:**  
> Build deep expertise in AI Infrastructure, Distributed Systems, and Cloud-Native Engineering while preparing for Big Tech-level engineering excellence.

## 🧩 Phase 1 (Weeks 1–8): Core Systems & Fundamentals

### 🎯 Goal
Strengthen foundations — system design, algorithmic fluency, and distributed systems concepts.

### 🗓️ Breakdown
#### **Weeks 1–2:** System Design Essentials  
- Topics: Scalability, load balancing, caching, queues, CAP theorem  
- Study: *Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)*  
- Practice: 1–2 architecture diagrams per week (Twitter, YouTube, URL shortener)

#### **Weeks 3–4:** Algorithms & Coding Warm-up  
- Focus on patterns (sliding window, recursion, graphs, heaps)  
- Solve 3 medium LeetCode problems per week  
- Document solutions on GitHub

#### **Weeks 5–8:** Distributed Systems Deep Dive  
- Learn Kafka internals, partitioning, replication, consumer lag  
- Explore Knative auto-scaling & Go concurrency patterns  

🧠 **Mini Project: “Event Stream Processor”**  
- Stack: Go + Kafka + Postgres + Knative  
- Simulate producers & consumers, monitor lag, auto-scale deployment  
- Output: GitHub repo + architecture diagram

---

## 🤖 Phase 2 (Weeks 9–16): AI Systems & LLM Infrastructure

### 🎯 Goal
Build applied experience with RAG pipelines, LLM orchestration, and scalable AI serving.

### 🗓️ Breakdown
#### **Weeks 9–10:** LLM & RAG Fundamentals  
- Topics: Tokenization, embeddings, vector DBs (Chroma/Milvus)  
- Tools: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ollama  
- Project: “Local Docs Q&A Bot” with Streamlit UI

#### **Weeks 11–13:** AI Infra & Scaling  
- Concepts: Batch inference, Ray Serve, vLLM, Knative auto-scaling  
- Add monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)  
- Containerize your RAG app

#### **Weeks 14–16:** Enterprise RAG Platform  
🧠 **Project: “Knowledge Hub”**  
- Stack: FastAPI + LangChain + Vector DB (Weaviate/Milvus)  
- Async ingestion, auth, caching, monitoring  
- Deploy with Knative or Docker Compose  
- Write a blog post on architecture learnings

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3 (Weeks 17–24): Integration, Visibility & Interview Prep

### 🎯 Goal
Integrate AI + distributed skills into production-grade projects, build visibility, and prepare for interviews.

### 🗓️ Breakdown
#### **Weeks 17–19:** LLM-as-a-Service Platform  
🧠 **Project: “LLMaaS”**  
- Multi-tenant REST API for LLMs  
- Queue handling (Kafka), autoscaling (Knative/KEDA)  
- Metrics dashboard (Grafana)  
- Output: Public GitHub repo + architecture doc

#### **Weeks 20–22:** System Design & Mock Interviews  
- 1 design/week (Chat System, RAG API, Vector Store)  
- Use Exponent / Pramp for mock interviews  
- Summarize designs in markdown

#### **Weeks 23–24:** Visibility & Applications  
- Write & publish 2–3 technical blogs:  
  - “Scaling RAG Systems with Knative + LangChain”  
  - “Serving LLMs Locally with Ollama and Ray Serve”  
- Update GitHub + LinkedIn + Resume  
- Start networking & applying to Big Tech / AI Infra roles

## 📅 Weekly Routine (Balanced with Work & Family)

| Day | Focus | Duration |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Mon–Wed** | Light reading, notes, or rest (due to extended work hours) | 0.5–1 hr |
| **Thu–Fri** | Focused learning or coding | 1–1.5 hr |
| **Sat–Sun** | Main project work, review, and blog writing | 4–5 hr/day |

💡 *Tip: Review milestones every 4 weeks. Celebrate progress — even small wins count.*
